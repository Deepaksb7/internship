### Key Directories Explained

- **`app/`**: Next.js 15 App Router directory containing all routes and layouts[3][1]
- **`components/`**: Reusable React components following atomic design principles
- **`context/`**: Context API providers for global state (assignments, user role)
- **`public/`**: Static assets like images, icons, and fonts

***

## 🏗️ Architecture & Design Decisions

### 1. **Next.js App Router (v15)**
Used the latest App Router for file-based routing, server components, and improved performance. Layouts are nested to apply admin-specific UI (sidebar) only where needed.[2][1]

### 2. **Context API for State Management**
Chose Context API over Redux/Zustand for simplicity since the app's state requirements are minimal. The `AssignmentsContext` manages:
- Assignment CRUD operations
- User role switching (Student/Admin)
- Local storage synchronization

### 3. **LocalStorage for Mock Backend**
Since no backend API was provided, implemented client-side data persistence using `localStorage`. Data is loaded on mount using `useEffect` to avoid SSR hydration errors.[4][5][6]

### 4. **Component-Based Architecture**
Followed modular component design for maintainability and reusability:
- **Presentational Components**: `AssignmentCard`, `ProgressBar`, `Topbar`
- **Container Components**: `AdminPage`, `StudentDashboard`
- **Utility Components**: `ConfirmationModal`, `Sidebar`

### 5. **Responsive Design with Tailwind CSS**
Used Tailwind's utility-first approach with responsive breakpoints (`sm:`, `md:`, `lg:`) to ensure mobile-first, fluid layouts without writing custom CSS.[1][3]

### 6. **TypeScript for Type Safety**
All components, contexts, and utilities are strongly typed to catch errors during development and improve IDE autocomplete support.[7][2]

***

## 🧩 Component Structure

### Core Components

#### `AssignmentCard.tsx`
Displays individual assignment details for students with:
- Assignment title, course, and due date
- Submission status badge
- "Mark as Submitted" button triggering confirmation modal
- Google Drive link for submission

#### `ConfirmationModal.tsx`
Double-verification modal to confirm assignment submission:
- First prompt: "Are you sure you've submitted?"
- Second confirmation: Final "Yes" or "Cancel"
- Prevents accidental submissions

#### `AdminAssignmentTable.tsx`
Table view for admin dashboard showing:
- Assignment details (title, course, due date)
- Submission status for each student
- Progress bars visualizing completion percentage
- Edit and Delete action buttons

#### `Sidebar.tsx`
Admin navigation sidebar with:
- User profile section
- Navigation links (Assignments, Students)
- Active route highlighting
- Mobile hamburger menu toggle

#### `ProgressBar.tsx`
Visual progress indicator showing:
- Percentage of assignments completed
- Color-coded (green for complete, orange for in-progress)
- Animated width transitions

***

## 🔄 State Management

### AssignmentsContext

The `AssignmentsContext` provides global state and actions:

```typescript
interface Assignment {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  course: string;
  dueDate: string;
  status: "Not Started" | "Submitted";
  driveLink?: string;
}

interface AssignmentsContextType {
  assignments: Assignment[];
  addAssignment: (assignment: Assignment) => void;
  updateAssignment: (id: string, updates: Partial<Assignment>) => void;
  deleteAssignment: (id: string) => void;
  role: "student" | "admin";
  setRole: (role: "student" | "admin") => void;
}
```

### LocalStorage Persistence

Data is persisted using `localStorage` with SSR-safe loading:

```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  // Load from localStorage after component mounts (client-side only)
  const stored = localStorage.getItem("assignments");
  if (stored) {
    setAssignments(JSON.parse(stored));
  }
}, []);

useEffect(() => {
  // Save to localStorage whenever assignments change
  localStorage.setItem("assignments", JSON.stringify(assignments));
}, [assignments]);
```

This approach avoids hydration mismatches in Next.js.[5][8][4]

***

## 🚢 Deployment
